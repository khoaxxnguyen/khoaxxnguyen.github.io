## Getting Started

We are using npm as our package manager.

> To use Yarn or any other package manager, delete the `package-lock.json` file and run the below commands using the package manager of your choice.

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and set the environment variables

3. Development server

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Your app template should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

   Additional commands:

   ```bash
   npm run build # Build the project
   npm run start # Start the production server
   ```
